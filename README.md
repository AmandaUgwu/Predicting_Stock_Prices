In this project, Iâ€™m learning how to predict stock prices using **Python, pandas, and scikit-learn**. Along the way, Iâ€™ll download stock prices, build a machine learning model, and develop a back-testing engine to evaluate its performance.  

Before diving in, I want to make sure this project has a **real-world application**. Even though this is for my portfolio, I want it to be as close to actual data science work as possibleâ€”something that hiring managers would find valuable. That means thinking carefully about the **error metrics** Iâ€™ll use and how my algorithm will be applied.  

For this project, Iâ€™m focusing on **trading stocks**. The goal is to make profitable trades while minimizing risk. I want to **buy stocks at market open** and **sell them at market close**, so I need a model that helps me predict whether the price will increase during the day.  

To get started, I downloaded **Standard Bank Group Limited Stock Price History** from **Yahoo Finance**. Now, Iâ€™ll prepare the data and train a model to make predictions. ðŸš€
